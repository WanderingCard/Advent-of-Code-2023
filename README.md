### Problem Summary
**Part One**
```
Given an input consisting of a number of games involving colored cubes pulled from a bag, determine what rounds are valid assuming that a max of 12 red, 13 green and 14 blue in the bag. Get the sum of the valid round numbers
```

**Part Two**
```
Figure out the minimum number of red, green and blue cubes that need to be in the bag assuming ALL rounds are valid. 

For each round multiply the minimum number of red, green and blue cubes together to get a round total. Sum up all the round totals for the final answer.
