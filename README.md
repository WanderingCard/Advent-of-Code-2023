# Advent of Code 2023
Overall Statistics:
```
Stars Earned: 6
Part Ones Finished: 3
Part Twos Finished: 3
Days Completed: 3 (Last: 12/3)
```
## Day One
> Language: Python

> Finished: 11:09 PM 12/1/2023

> Parts Finished: 1 and 2

### Problem Summary
Part One:
> File containing calibration data stored within a file (DayOne.txt) find the first and last digit in each line, combine them to get a value and sum each line's value

Part Two:
> File lines contain word values of digits (I.E One, Two, Three, etc.) include those and perform the same calculation as part one.

## Day Two
> Language: Python

> Finished: 7:19 AM 12/2/2023

> Finished Both Parts

### Problem Summary
**Part One**
> Given an input consisting of a number of games involving colored cubes pulled from a bag, determine what rounds are valid assuming that a max of 12 red, 13 green and 14 blue in the bag. Get the sum of the valid round numbers


**Part Two**
> Figure out the minimum number of red, green and blue cubes that need to be in the bag assuming ALL rounds are valid. For each round multiply the minimum number of red, green and blue cubes together to get a round total. Sum up all the round totals for the final answer.


## Day Three
> Language: Python
> Finished: 7:40 AM 12/3/2023
> Finished Both Parts

### Problem Summary
**Part One**
> Given an input consisting of numbers and symbols, find the missing part numbers. Missing part numbers are numbers adjacent to some symbol (not including .). Find the sum of the missing part numbers.

**Part Two**
> Given the same input, find missing gears and their ratios. A gear is defined as any * symbol with exactly 2 values adjacent to it. The ratio is those numbers multiplied together. Sum up the ratios to get the final answer
